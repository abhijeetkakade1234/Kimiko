## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook (The Problem)
**Visual**: Close-up of the Landing Page. Slow scroll down the "Tactical HUD" background.
**Audio (Voiceover)**: 
"On Solana, your financial history is an open book. Every transaction, every dApp interaction, every degen trade is a signal for institutional scrapers to profile you. This is mass financial surveillance. Welcome to Kimiko—the Digital Zen of Privacy."

## 0:30 - 1:15 | The Analyzer (The Solution)
**Visual**: Enter a wallet address (or click a sample address). Show the "Analyzing" loader with the tactical CRT scanlines.
**Audio**: 
"Kimiko doesn't just scan your wallet; it decrypts your behavioral fingerprints. Our 'Seishin' engine analyzes CEX correlations, address reuse, and temporal patterns to show you exactly how visible you are to the world."
**Visual**: Show the Analysis Result page. Highlight the **Privacy Score** and **Compliance Tier**.
"We transform technical jargon into actionable intel. Are you a 'High-Risk' profile because of a timing leak? Kimiko gives you the step-by-step path to regain your Digital Zen."

## 1:15 - 2:00 | The Privacy Shield (Inco Integration)
**Visual**: Click the "Protect Identity" or "Shield Score" button. Show the IncoShield encryption progress.
**Audio**: 
"But analysis is only the beginning. Using the Inco Lightning Network and Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Kimiko creates a 'Selective Visibility' shield. By encrypting your reputation score on-chain, you can prove your legitimacy to dApps without ever revealing your underlying transaction history."
**Visual**: Highlight the "Encrypted Attestation" card showing the Confidentiality proof.

## 2:00 - 2:40 | Track Specialization (Track 2)
**Visual**: Navigate to the **Privacy Guide** page. Scroll through the "Philosophy of Selective Visibility."
**Audio**: 
"We believe privacy should be accessible. Our 'Privacy Without Jargon' guide strips away the complex crypto-speak, teaching users that privacy isn't about hiding—it's about Consensual Disclosure. You choose what the world sees."

### Tips for Recording:
1. **Resolution**: Record in 1080p centered on the browser.
2. **Speed**: Don't rush. The "Zen" theme works better with deliberate, smooth movements.
3. **Cursor**: Use a high-quality mouse cursor or hide it to emphasize the UI animations.
