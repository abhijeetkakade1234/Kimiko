# Kimiko: Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic journey for **Kimiko**, from its hackathon foundation to a comprehensive privacy ecosystem on Solana.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation (Hackathon MVP)
**Focus**: Core analysis engine and premium user interface.
- [x] **Project Scaffolding**: Next.js 14 setup with dark-mode/glassmorphism UI.
- [x] **Solana Integration**: Transaction fetching (Helius) and parsing logic.
- [x] **Privacy Scoring Engine**: Initial weighted model for CEX exposure & reuse.
- [x] **Leakage Map**: Visual representation of wallet clustering risks.
- [x] **Compliance Tiering**: Automated risk classification (Low, Med, High).

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Visualization
**Focus**: Deepening the analysis and enhancing UX.
- [ ] **Advanced Graphing**: D3.js integration for deep-dive network analysis.
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Bridge Detection**: Tracking funds through Wormhole, Allbridge, etc.
- [ ] **Temporal Fingerprinting**: Detecting bot-like behavior and automation patterns.
- [ ] **Historical Tracking**: Monitor privacy score changes over time.
- [ ] **Enhanced UI**: Interactive charts and downloadable PDF privacy reports.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Developer Platform
**Focus**: Enabling other protocols to build on Kimiko.
- [ ] **Public REST API**: For institutional and protocol integration.
- [ ] **TypeScript SDK**: Easy-to-use npm package for Solana web3 developers.
- [ ] **Zk-Proof Integration**: Prove "Low Risk" status without revealing the score.
- [ ] **White-Label Components**: Drop-in UI components for other wallet dashboards.

---

## 🏆 Phase 4: Institutional & Enterprise
**Focus**: Scaling for large-scale compliance and security.
- [ ] **Batch Analysis**: Scanning thousands of wallets for treasury management.
- [ ] **Compliance Rule Engine**: Custom risk thresholding for institutional clients.
- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring**: Alerts for sudden privacy exposure or high-risk links.
- [ ] **Governance Token (Future)**: Decentralizing the "Known Addresses" database.
